qtxdg-tools (3.9.1-0ubuntu1~ppa1) jammy; urgency=medium

  * Backport to Jammy.
  * Removed "-Wl,--as-needed" linker flag.
  * Removed Repository-Browser field from debian/upstream/metadata.
  * Ignored missing manual page for qtxdg-mat.
  * Ignored executable in library package.
    - (Reasoning: it makes sense for the package to be a library and have
    - an executable in it).
  * Ignored wrong changelog file name.
    - (Reasoning: The changelog file is very short, named "CHANGELOG" in
    - the package, and it would be overkill to try to change the filename.)
